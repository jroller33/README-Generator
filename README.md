  ## Installation
  1. Clone the repo (https://github.com/jroller33/README-Generator)
  2. Run `npm i` and then `node index.js` to start.
  
  ## Usage
  You will be asked a series of questions about the content for your README. The README that's generated will follow the same layout as this README.md and will be created in the same directory as 'index.js'. To write the README to a different path, follow these steps:
  1. open index.js
  2. go to line 66 (`.then((data) => writeFile('README.md', generateMarkdown(data)))`)
  3. Paste the path of the directory you want the README created in before 'README.md'. Example: `.then((data) => writeFile('/user/Documents/README.md', generateMarkdown(data)))`
